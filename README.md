# Mixie

A Spotify playlist manager thats work in progress/proof of concept
This was quickly hacked together so that I could easily mix different playlists together based on song features. 
There were plans to visualise the features so that I can easily group together similar songs but it is yet to be completed. 
I want to rewrite this completely in JS so that no server would be needed to run this and everything can be done locally.
